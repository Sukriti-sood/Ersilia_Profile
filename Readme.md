The Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI) aims to democratize access to machine learning tools so as to strengthen research capacity against infectious and neglected diseases.

## About us

The Ersilia Open Source Initiative is a Non Profit Organization incorporated with the Charity Commission for England and Wales (number 1192266). We equip universities, hospitals, and laboratories in low-resourced countries with artificial intelligence tools for infectious and neglected disease research.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement


We value and care for every one of our employees, contributors, and customers, and make them feel like they are part of our organization's efforts to improve global health. Our belief is that a diverse team is the only way to understand and address the health needs of different regions of the world, so we do not only not discriminate, but we recognize each unique background in terms of education, color, race, gender identity and expression, age, religion, national origin, citizenship or refugee status, and disability.

## What we do?

We support researchers in low-resource settings by using machine learning and data science. We develop tools to speed up experiments and reduce the cost of developing new drugs together. We created an open source platform to enable researchers to access AI/ML expertise. With our platform, wet-lab scientists and clinicians can browse collections of models and run predictions without having to write a single line of code or pay for expensive software licenses.

## Contributing to the ecosystem

We aim to provide computational tools that simplify and speed up day-to-day research. Learn more about our ecosystem through our projects:

- [Ersilia Model Hub](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/): The Ersilia Model Hub is the main project of the Ersilia Open Source Initiative. It is an open-source repository of AI/ML models for global health and neglected diseases.
- [ZairaChem](https://github.com/ersilia-os/zaira-chem): Automated QSAR based on multiple small molecule descriptors. Ersilia's first library focuses on delivering out-of-the-box machine learning solutions for biomedical problems.
- [Capacity Building](https://www.ersilia.io/capacity-building): We are creating resources focused on the dissemination of computational skills (AI/ML and others) to scientists in different fields.
- [Open Source Malaria Series 4](https://github.com/ersilia-os/osm-series4-candidates-2): The Open Source Malaria Project has released a new set of candidate molecules from series 4, including molecules generated from low-data generative models (adapted from the ETH Modlab) and molecules created using a revised Reinvent 2.0 generative model with improved activity predictors.

## How to get involved?

EOSI is a developing organization that requires contributions from all stages of the software development lifecycle. We are looking for contributions in the following areas:-

- **Technical documentation** (readme files, contribution guidelines, low-level documentation of pyhton)

- **Scientific content** (reading papers, summarizing scientific findings for dissemination, finding new models for the hub...)

- **Outreach material** (blogpost, social media interactions)

- **Graphical skills** (making slides and videos for users and contributors to support the written docs)

- **Code Contributions**

## Contact

As a developer you can use Github issues and discussions on the respective projects to report bugs, request features, and discuss changes. We recommend using issues to connect with maintainers, coaches and ambassadors.

You can also contact us through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/outreachyersilia/shared_invite/zt-16iu1wckw-7KCgMGlIeRBBrDgyXkENeg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ersiliaio), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ersiliaio/) or [Mail](hello@ersilia.io).

You can support us by via [Open Collective](https://github.com/opencollective.com/ersilia).
